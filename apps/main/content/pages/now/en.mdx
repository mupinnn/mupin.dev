I currently live in Jakarta, Indonesia (GMT+7) and here are some of the things that Iâ€™m doing right now and trying to figure out:

- Practicing English daily
- Slowly figuring out the best schedule for me to study computer science fundamentals and drilling with LeetCode or HackerRank
- Getting my side projects backlog done one by one
