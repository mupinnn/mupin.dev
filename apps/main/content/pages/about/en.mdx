A passionate front-end developer with 2+ years of experience developing user interfaces around the web. I'm helping to bridge
the gap between design and technical implementation for crafting seamless user experiences.

With a strong fundamentals in web technology, I thrive on the challenge of modern web development. From slicing design into responsive
web apps that adapt flawlessly across devices to optimizing performance both runtime or build time for fast load times and deployment.

I collaborate closely with UI/UX designers and back-end developers to ensure consistency and maintainability within our platforms. I'm 
experienced in React ecosystem from barebone React to full-fledged Next.js. I also had a nice experience using Vue and Nuxt, and I'm 
always eager to explore new tools that can strengthen my skills.

I've had a pleasure of contributing to Juragan Material's internal design system and planning the architecture of some of their front-end 
apps. These experiences honed my technical expertise really well.

are really helpful for me, you, or us. Sharing is caring.

Say a "Hi!" to me, don't be shy.
