As a modern front-end developer, I am quite spoiled by the ease of Git integration from Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
such as Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages for deployment. It takes just a few clicks to set up and push changes
using Git for continuous deployment. Life has never been easier.

Behind all these conveniences, our needs as developers sometimes cannot be met by the existing PaaS, so additional steps
are needed to meet these needs. An example is when you want to deploy only when there is a new tag in your project's
remote repository—or other deployment strategies.

In this article, I want to write the deployment steps I did for my project:
[Kaget (Kawan Budget)](https://kaget.mupin.dev/). This article will use the blog project template from Astro. Simply
put, the deployment flow that is carried out will be as follows:

1. Every push to the main branch will be treated as a preview/staging deployment with its own URL.
2. When a new tag is pushed to the main branch, it will be considered a production deployment with
   https://kaget.mupin.dev/ as its URL.

I use Cloudflare Pages for hosting, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and GitHub Releases to manage tags and release notes.

## The Problem

### Only supports push-to-deploy

By default, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, and Netlify do not support tag-based deployment out-of-the-box. Therefore, GitHub
Actions plays a crucial role here—as well as the support of CLI tools from each platform. Cloudflare has Wrangler as
their CLI tool so that developers can interact with Cloudflare services via CLI (command-line interface).

### Wrangler takes all the convenience out of Cloudflare Pages

With Wrangler, we get the flexibility to set how our project will be deployed, but the ease of Cloudflare Pages will be
gone.

Originally, in Cloudflare Pages, we can easily choose which branch will be used as a production deployment through the
dashboard and all other branches will be considered as preview deployments. By default, Cloudflare Pages will do a build
and deploy on every push; this allows us to have a unique deployment URL for each commit or branch.

These things should be gone or we can create them manually for the flexibility we want.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is one of GitHub’s features for CI/CD processes—automating application development processes, such as
build, test, and deployment.

I use GitHub Actions of course because I put my project repository on GitHub, so all the processes are more seamless—and
of course, it’s free!

## What are Cloudflare Pages?

Cloudflare Pages is one of Cloudflare’s services for hosting web applications Cloudflare Pages features are very
complete:

1. Build and deploy automatically
2. Unlimited collaboration. Add unlimited team members at no cost
3. Integration with Cloudflare Workers for dynamic applications; server-side rendering to server functions
4. Integration with free, privacy-first built-in analytics
5. Unlimited bandwidth
6. Unlimited static requests

Since I also use Cloudflare DNS service, it makes it easier for me when I need a custom domain. In addition, there are
many cases of developers whose hobby projects suddenly get a lot of traffic so that they reach/exceed the
bandwidth/static request limits set by other providers—that’s why I have Cloudflare Pages ready before the bill
comes—_eh?_

The web analytics provided are also why I tried Cloudflare Pages. Currently, I use self-hosted Umami with Supabase to
store my data. This combination worked great for about 6 months; however, one annoying thing is that I need to make sure
my Supabase doesn’t go into pause mode. Supabase does this on the free tier after a week of inactivity.

## Preparation

Here are some things you need to prepare before reading further:

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your device
- Text editor
- Node.js package manager such as: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- Cloudflare account

### Creating a project with Astro

We will use the blog starter template from Astro by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ pnpm create astro --template blog
```

Follow the prompts and make sure you select **“Yes”** for installing dependencies and initializing the Git repository.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/creating-astro-project.png"
  alt="Terminal view when creating a blog project with a template from Astro"
/>

Make sure the project is running smoothly in development by running `pnpm dev` and is also buildable with `pnpm build`.

### Setting up a repository on GitHub

After successfully creating a project with Astro and making sure everything works well, the next step is to create a
remote repository on GitHub and bring our blog project there.

1. Visit https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the repository name only and leave the other fields, then click **“Create repository”**
3. After the remote repository is created, two guides will appear to push our local repository to the remote repository
   we just created. Follow the steps in the red box below:

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/preparing-remote-repo-1.png"
  alt="An empty GitHub repository view contains instructions for pushing to that repository."
/>

4. Reload the page and make sure your remote repository looks something like this:

  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/preparing-remote-repo-2.png"
  alt="GitHub repository view after push"
/>

### Get Cloudflare API Token

Before using Wrangler CLI, we need two credentials from Cloudflare; namely API Token and Account ID.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to the **“My Profile”** menu in the upper right corner by clicking the user icon
3. Go to the **“API Tokens”** menu, then click **“Create Token”**
4. Select **“Custom Token”**, then click **“Get started”**
5. Give any name to the API Token to be created in the **“Token name”** column
6. Then, in the **“Permissions”** section, select **Account**, **Cloudflare Pages**, and **Edit** (select the options in
   order from left to right)
7. Click **“Continue to summary”**, then click **“Create token”**
8. Copy and save the token for later use in Github Actions and APIs

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/create-cf-api-token.png"
  alt="Cloudflare user page when creating API Token"
/>

### Get Cloudflare Project Account ID

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to the **“Workers & Pages”** menu
3. There is a **“Account Details”** section on the right side, there is a **“Account ID”** column. Click to copy the
   contents
4. Save the Account ID for later use in GitHub Actions and APIs

## Creating Github Actions workflows

Workflows are configurable automated processes that will run one or more jobs (hereinafter referred to as jobs).
Workflows are defined by YAML files that can be run based on an event, run manually, or even scheduled.

Workflow files are stored in the `.github/workflows` folder in a repository. Therefore, our first step is to create a
`.github/workflows` folder in our blog project.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/create-workflow-file-1.png"
  alt="Project directory view after creating .github/workflows folder"
/>

Then, create a `deploy.yml` file inside the `.github/workflows` folder.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/create-workflow-file-2.png"
  alt=".github/workflows directory that contain deploy.yml file"
/>

### Defining triggers, permissions, and environment variables

Basically, there are three important components in a workflow: events, jobs, and steps. Events are the determinants of
when a workflow will be executed. Jobs are tasks that run on their respective virtual machines that are run in parallel
by default. Each job can have several steps that can run a script that we create or a package/action available in the
marketplace.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/workflow-big-picture.png"
  alt="Big picture of a workflow from GitHub Actions"
/>

In this project, I want the workflow to be run on:

1. Every time there is a push to the main branch
2. Every time there is a new release from Github Releases
3. Can be run manually by selecting the destination environment of the deployment as desired. The options are staging
   and production

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloduflare Pages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Choose an environment to deploy to:"
        required: true
        default: "staging"
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  release:
    types: [released]
```

First, the name. Like a prayer, name your workflow as well as possible. In the name key, you can give a name to the
workflow that will be created.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```

Second, events. Events are defined inside the `on` key.

```yaml
on:
  event_name:
  event_name_2:
  event_name_n:
```

To run a workflow manually, we can use the `workflow_dispatch` event. This event accepts a maximum of 10 inputs. Inputs
function as option columns that we can choose to influence the running of a workflow. There are various data types to
define an input, such as `boolean`, `choice`, `number`, `environment`, and `string`. Further explanation can be read at
[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_dispatchinputsinput_idtype)

As an example:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      logLevel:
        description: "Log level"
        required: true
        default: "warning"
        type: choice
        options:
          - info
          - warning
          - debug
      tags:
        description: "Test scenario tags"
        required: false
        type: boolean
      environment:
        description: "Environment to run tests against"
        type: environment
        required: true
```

The above configuration will product inputs as below.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/workflow-inputs-example.png"
  alt="Example of displaying input results from a workflow"
/>

Okey, back to the main topic. With the configuration that we have made above, the inputs produced will be like this

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/workflow-inputs-real.png"
  alt="The results of the inputs from the workflow we created"
/>

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Choose an environment to deploy to:"
        required: true
        default: "staging"
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
```

Next, we need to define a push event to execute this workflow when there is a push to the main branch.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Choose an environment to deploy to:"
        required: true
        default: "staging"
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

In addition to `branches`, there are also `tags` and `paths`. So, why don’t we use tags here too? Because events in
GitHub Actions are like logical OR. If we define an event like this:

```yaml
on:
	push:
		branches:
			- main
		tags:
			- 'v**'
```

So, the workflow will be run when there is a push to the main branch OR a push tag with the prefix “v”. It takes a
little acrobatics if you want a workflow to run when there is a push tag to the main branch. Therefore, we will only use
the `release` event which I will explain next.

Next, run the workflow when a new release with a tag is created from GitHub Releases. The `release` event has at least
seven types, namely:

- `published`
- `unpublished`
- `created`
- `edited`
- `deleted`
- `prereleased`
- `released`

Each has its own use and the one we will use is only `released`. We don’t need `draft` and `pre-release` yet, so we
don’t need the `published` type. Further explanation can be read at
[Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#release)

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/release-event-1.png"
  alt="GitHub Releases view when you want to make a new release"
/>

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Choose an environment to deploy to:"
        required: true
        default: "staging"
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  release:
    types: [released]
```

After the event is done, we need to define permissions so that our workflow can run smoothly and use what we need. In
this workflow, we only need two permissions: `contents` and `deployments`. You can see what permissions are available at
[Workflow permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions)

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write
```

Next, we need an environment variable to determine whether the workflow is currently running for production or staging.
We will use the environment variable in the last step, which is deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

```yaml
env:
  IS_PRODUCTION: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment == 'production' || github.event_name == 'release' }}
```

`IS_PRODUCTION` will be `true` if the workflow is manually run with the `production` option or the workflow is run
because it was triggered by a release event. For our main purpose, the difference between staging and production is the
tag or release.

So far, our `deploy.yml` file will look like this:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Choose an environment to deploy to:"
        required: true
        default: "staging"
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  release:
    types: [released]

permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write

env:
  IS_PRODUCTION: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment == 'production' || github.event_name == 'release' }}
```

Fasten your seat belts, because we’re about to dive into the ocean of jobs!

### Defining jobs

Jobs in GitHub Actions run in parallel by default. However, we can define them to run sequentially with the key
`jobs.<job_id>.needs`. In this workflow, we will define two jobs: `build` and `deploy`.

```yaml
jobs:
	build:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
		 - . . .

	deploy:
		needs: build
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- . . .
```

The `runs-on` key is needed to define where the job we create will be run. `ubuntu-latest` means the job will be run on
a virtual machine with the latest version of Ubuntu Linux OS. There are many other runner options that you can see at
[Workflow runners](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#choosing-github-hosted-runners).

Then, there is the `needs` key which means the job needs to wait for the `build` job to complete before running.
Actually, we can just create one job—but that is not recommended, especially since we need to install dependencies and
build before doing the deployment; if the deployment fails, we need to repeat the entire job from the beginning. Unlike
separating the `build` and `deploy` jobs, when `deploy` fails, we can just rerun the `deploy` job.

For the `build` job, we need a few steps:

1. Use the `actions/checkout@v4` action to check out our repository so that our workflow can access the code
2. Since I am using `pnpm`, I need to use the `pnpm/action-setup@v4` action to install `pnpm`
3. To use the `pnpm` cache feature, we need to follow these steps
   [`pnpm/action-setup` documentation](https://github.com/pnpm/action-setup?tab=readme-ov-file#use-cache-to-reduce-installation-time)
4. The next step is to run the build with `run: pnpm build`
5. Once the build is complete, we need to upload the build file to
   [artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/storing-and-sharing-data-from-a-workflow)
   so that the file can be used by the next _job_ or even another _workflow_. For this, we use
   `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 8
          run_install: false

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: "pnpm"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: ./dist
```

For `npm` users, you don't need `pnpm/action-setup@v4` and just need to change a few commands.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: ./dist
```

For `yarn` users, you can try to adjust with the following _action_
[GitHub Action for Yarn](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-yarn)

Next, for the `deploy` _job_! The steps we need are:

1. Download the _artifacts_ that we uploaded in the previous _job_ using the `actions/download-artifact@v4` action
2. Since each _job_ runs on an independent machine, we need to install `pnpm` again using the `pnpm/action-setup@v4`
   action
3. Finally, we will use the `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` action to do the _deployment_ to Cloudflare Pages.

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Download artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: ./dist

    - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      with:
        version: 8

    - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
        accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
        gitHubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        packageManager: pnpm
        command: |
          pages deploy dist --project-name=kaget --branch=${{ env.IS_PRODUCTION == 'true' && 'production' || 'main' }}
```

Remember the _API Token_ and _Account ID_ that we prepared at the beginning of this article? Well, these two things are
needed in this step to use Wrangler CLI via `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` action.

We will add the _API Token_ and _Account ID_ to GitHub Secrets.

1. Open the repository page that we have created
2. Click **“Settings”** > **“Secrets and variables”** > **“Actions”**
3. Click **“New repository secret”**
4. Fill in the name column with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
5. Fill in the _value_ column with the _API Token_ that we have created, then click **“Add secret”**
6. Repeat from step three with the name and _value_ for `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/workflow-secrets-1.png"
  alt="View for secrets configuration in GitHub Actions"
/>

The secrets that we have created can be accessed from the workflow using `secrets.<name>`. For `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` is
automatically provided by GitHub using a certain permission.

Next, pay attention to the `command` argument in the **“Deploy to Cloudflare Pages”** step. The
`cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` action allows us to override the default `command` as needed.

There are several arguments that I use here so that this deployment runs as desired:

- `--project-name`
  - The name of the project you want to deploy. Adjust it to the repository name or the one listed on the “Workers &
    Pages” dashboard.
- `--branch`
  - The name of the branch you want to deploy. As you can see, in this branch argument I use a ternary condition with
    the `IS_PRODUCTION` environment variables; if `true` then the branch that will be deployed is `production` and if
    `false`, then the `main` branch will be deployed.

```yaml
command: |
	pages deploy dist --project-name=kaget --branch=${{ env.IS_PRODUCTION == 'true' && 'production' || 'main' }}
```

Our workflow is complete. Time to prove it!

## First deployment

Sebelum kita _commit_ dan _push_ _worklfow_ yang sudah dibuat, ada satu hal yang perlu kita pastikan—yaitu membuat
proyek baru di _dashboard_ Cloudflare Pages.

Before we commit and push the workflow that has been created, there is one thing we need to make sure of—that is, create
a new project in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.

1. Open the Cloudflare dashboard
2. In the upper right corner, find and click **“+ Add”** then click **“Pages”**. Later, the **“Workers & Pages”** menu
   will appear in the sidebar menu on the left

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-1.png"
  alt="Workers & Pages view in Cloudflare dashboar when creating a new project"
/>

3. Click **“Create”** > Select the **“Pages”** tab > Select the direct upload option
4. Fill in the project name column according to the repository name or according to what we sent in the `--project-name`
   argument from the Wrangler CLI earlier
5. Then click **“Create project”**

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-2.png"
  alt="View after creating project in Workers & Pages page"
/>

6. Go back to the **“Workers & Pages”** page. There is no need to upload any assets as we will upload them via GitHub
   Actions

Once al the settings are done, it’s time to commit and push our workflow file.

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "chore: setup workflows"
$ git push
```

Go to our repository page, click on **“Actions”** and you will see that there is a workflow running. You can click on it
to see the details, even the details of each job and step that is running.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-3.png"
  alt="Actions view on repository that display running or completed workflow"
/>

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-4.png"
  alt="Detail view from a workflow. You can see the jobs are connected"
/>

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-5.png"
  alt="Detail view of each job from a workflow. You can see the running steps inside the job"
/>

Take a look at the last image and notice the deployment URL—that’s right, there’s some sort of unique hash there. Let’s
take a look at the **“Workers & Pages”** dashboard and see the project details.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-6.png"
  alt="Workers & Pages page that show project lists in Cloudflare Pages"
/>

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/first-deployment-7.png"
  alt="Cloudflare Pages project's detail page"
/>

We got two URLs! One main URL https://blog-poc-cf-pages-tag-based-deployment.pages.dev/ and the second one with a unique
hash for each commit \*\*https://e0c3013f.blog-poc-cf-pages-tag-based-deployment.pages.dev/. If there is a new
deployment, then it can be accessed via the main URL and the URL with the latest hash. Then, can we still access the
previous deployment? Of course! With the note, it can only be accessed via the associated URL.

Please note, that the main URL will be assigned by Cloudflare Pages to the main branch (`main`/ `master`) and is
considered as a production deployment.

## Deployment to production

We will use GitHub Releases to create a tag and record what changes have occurred in this production release.

First, go to our repository page and look on the right side for the **“Releases”** section. Click **“Create a new
release”**.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/production-deployment-1.png"
  alt="GitHub repository main page. There is a red box that indicating the location of the Releases section"
/>

Then, create a new tag in the **“Choose a tag”** field. We will create a `v1.0.0` tag as the initial version.

<CloudinaryImg
  src="/blog/tag-based-deployment-for-cloudflare-pages-using-github-actions/production-deployment-2.png"
  alt="Create tag view on GitHub Releases page"
/>

Then, click **“Generate release notes”**. This will automatically create release notes based on the commit history of
the successfully merged pull requests. For now, since there are no pull requests that have been merged, the release
notes appear empty.

Next, click **“Publish release”** and see there will be a workflow running!

Take a look at the `deploy` job on the **“Deploy to Cloudflare Pages”** step. We have successfully set the deployment
based on the tag from GitHub Releases, so the `--branch` argument should contain `production`.

To make sure whether the previous deployment is really considered as production by Cloudflare Pages, we need to see it
in our project’s **“Workers & Pages”** dashboard.

We can see the image below. Actually, we don’t have a `production` branch, but the `--branch` argument allows us to
distinguish a deployment by only having one branch.

Another odd thing is that our `production` branch is still considered a preview deployment by Cloudflare Pages; that is,
our main URL (https://blog-poc-cf-pages-tag-based-deployment.pages.dev/) still has the old content because it still
points to the previous deployment. Of course, this is not following our goals. We want deployment to production only
when there is a new tag. Any changes that are pushed to the `main` branch, if they are not ready for release, will not
available on the main URL—only on the preview URL.

## Set the `production` branch as a production environment

Unfortunately, if we use the direct upload method to deploy our project to Cloudflare Pages, there is no way to set the
branch used for the production environment from the dashboard. We have to do it through the API endpoint provided by
Cloudflare.

Run the following command in your terminal. Don’t forget to prepare your API Token, Account ID, and project name.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/pages/projects/{project_name}" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data "{\"production_branch\": \"production\"}"
```

After success, we need to do another deployment to apply the changes. Run the workflow manually by selecting the
`production` option as the target environment.

  alt="Actions page that show the inputs for running the workflow manually"
/>

Then, check your **“Workers & Pages”** dashboard and our production environment is on the right track. Maybe, it feels
like there is no difference between production and preview for now. You can try to make changes to your project. In my
experiment, I changed the title on the home page in the `src/pages/index.astro` file and then pushed the changes to the
main branch. This is where the difference will appear. My main URL
(https://blog-poc-cf-pages-tag-based-deployment.pages.dev/) has no changes, while if you access the preview deployment
from the `main` branch, you can see a difference in the title
(https://main.blog-poc-cf-pages-tag-based-deployment.pages.dev/).

<blockquote>
    
💡 In addition to the unique hash, the deployment preview can also be accessed via the branch name such as 
    `<branch>.<project>.pages.dev`. This URL is an alias for the latest deployment on the branch.

## Conclusion

Cloudflare Pages and its ecosystem can be considered a very promising alternative. We never know when we can get
unlimited bandwidth for the site we created. In addition, integration with the Git provider also makes it very easy and
can be said to be quite competitive with similar platforms.

Maybe some of you will think “Why on earth is a front-end developer tinkering with CI/CD? That’s the job of
DevOps”—trust me, CI/CD is a general concept that every developer needs to understand; at least knowing what is needed
to make a project ready for production—starting from lint, test, build, and which files are used.

Understanding CI/CD is also useful for hobby projects because we work alone—like what I’m doing right now.

Thank you!
