## Introduction

Gunpla, short for "Gundam Plastic Model," is a popular hobby that involves constructing scale models of robots from the Gundam franchise. Spanning over four decades, Gunpla has grown beyond a simple pastime, evolving into an artistic pursuit for enthusiasts worldwide. This blog post will delve into the origins of Gunpla, its cultural significance, and the community that surrounds it.

## The Origins of Gunpla

Gunpla originated in Japan in 1980, with the release of the first Mobile Suit Gundam series. Bandai, the official manufacturer, launched the model kits alongside the series, and they quickly gained popularity. These early models required glue and paint, making them a complex task for beginners. Over time, Bandai improved the design, introducing "snap fit" pieces and color molding, which made the kits more accessible to a broader audience.

## The Cultural Significance of Gunpla

Gunpla holds a significant cultural status in Japan and has spread across the globe. It's not just a hobby but an expression of creativity and craftsmanship. The hobby encourages patience, attention to detail, and creativity, as builders customize their models with unique paint jobs and modifications. Annual competitions such as the Gunpla Builders World Cup showcase this creativity, with entrants presenting highly detailed and imaginative designs.

## The Gunpla Community

The Gunpla community is an integral part of the hobby. Online forums and social media groups provide platforms for builders to share their creations, offer advice, and foster friendships. Local hobby shops often host build days, allowing enthusiasts to come together and build in a social setting. The community's welcoming and supportive nature encourages new builders to take up the hobby and helps experienced builders to continue refining their skills.

## Conclusion

From its origins in Japan to its global popularity today, Gunpla is more than just a hobby - it's a form of art, a cultural phenomenon, and a community. Whether you're a long-time builder or a curious newcomer, there's always a new model to build, a new technique to learn, and a fellow builder ready to share their passion with you. Dive into the world of Gunpla, and you might just find a rewarding new hobby.

# A demo of `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

* Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
* Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
* Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `'h1'`)
* Has a lot of plugins

## Contents

Here is an example of a plugin in action
([`remark-toc`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)).
**This section is replaced by an actual table of contents**.

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js title="This is title" caption="This is caption" {1-3,4} showLineNumbers
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Markdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

const markdown = `
# Your markdown here
`

ReactDOM.render(
  <Markdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>{markdown}</Markdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating();

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can *also* use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

| Feature    | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
| GFM        | 100% w/ `remark-gfm` |

~~strikethrough~~

* [ ] task list
* [x] checked item

## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).

<blockquote>

## Components

You can pass components to change things:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Markdown from 'react-markdown'
import MyFancyRule from './components/my-fancy-rule.js'

const markdown = `
# Your markdown here
`

ReactDOM.render(
  <Markdown
    components={{
      // Use h2s instead of h1s
      h1: 'h2',
      // Use a component instead of hrs
      hr(props) {
        const {node, ...rest} = props
        return <MyFancyRule {...rest} />
      }
    }}
  >
    {markdown}
  </Markdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```
