I currently live in **Jakarta, Indonesia** (GMT+7) and here are some of the things that Iâ€™m doing right now and trying to figure out:

- Trying to practice English day by day
- Slowly figuring out the best schedule for me to study computer science fundamentals and drilling with LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces
- Getting my side projects backlog done one by one
- **Pursuing full remote job**
